## Sharing

![[LIVECODES-Obsidian-v1.5.11-2024-03-19-12.45.01.png]]

### Short share URL

> [!warning] Notice
> This requires sending the playground configuration (**including source code**) to a server that saves the code and provides a short Id which can be used to retrieve the playground. **It cannot then be deleted**.

The app hosted on [https://livecodes.io](https://livecodes.io/) uses an API endpoint specifically provided to generate short URLs for LiveCodes share service. We will make every effort to keep that online and available for free use, so long as it is not abused.

Short URLs generated by LiveCodes share service are **private** by default and are not listed or indexed.

See [Livecodes documentation](https://livecodes.io/docs/features/share) page on sharing for further up-to-date details.

Default: `disabled`

### Github API token

Add a Github API token to enable creating gists from a playground. Create a token at [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (only gist permission required)

### Github gist privacy

Gists can be public or secret. public gists show up in [Github Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover), where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work.

Secret gists don't show up in [Github Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover) and are not searchable unless you are logged in and are the author of the secret gist. Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist.

After creating a gist, you cannot convert it from public to secret. However, a secret gist can be made public by editing the gist and updating the visibility to public.

See [Github gist documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) page on creating gists for further up-to-date details.

### Enable AI

LiveCodes supports AI-powered code completion, completely for **free** with **no account or API token required**, powered by [Codeium](https://codeium.com/), the ultrafast Copilot alternative.

The large generative machine learning model is capable of understanding the context of your code and comments in order to generate suggestions on what you might want to type next.

It has a wide range of language support.

Currently, only Monaco editor is supported. Wider editor support is planned.

> [!warning] Notice
> Please note that when using Codeium AI assistant, your code is sent to their servers for code completion. However, your code is not used for training their model. Check Codeium [FAQ](https://codeium.com/faq#Will-Codeium-regurgitate-private-code%3F) and [privacy policy](https://codeium.com/privacy-policy) for more details.
